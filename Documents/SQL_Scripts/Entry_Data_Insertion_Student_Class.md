# Entry Data Insertion - Student Class

## Overview
This document contains the finalized SQL scripts for inserting metadata related to the Student Class table into the `core_label` and `core_entry` tables. All labels and entries have been fully inserted for the Student Class table (`table_id_id` = 3), based on the schema provided in the Learning@Scale Data Dictionary. Each `core_label` row represents a unique column in the dataset, while corresponding `core_entry` rows provide rich field-level metadata such as descriptions, categories, source systems, and sample values.

Note:
- `label_id` values are explicitly inserted into the `core_label` table and must match the `label_id` references used in the `core_entry` insert statements.
- `entry_id` is autogenerated and does not need to be included manually.
